# OpenPNM Examples

[![](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/workflows/Examples/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PMEAL/OpenPNM/actions)

This folder contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks illustrating the use of OpenPNM.  Jupyter Notebooks allows for a helpful combination of formatted text and functioning code.  You can browse the available files by clicking through the web interface of the repository seen above.

The examples are organized by the directory structure, with folders and files given somewhat descriptive names to indicate what sort of example they contain.

All these notebooks are subjected to our testing suite on each build of the package.  If the badge above says 'passing', then all the examples found here should be functional and compatible with the current version of OpenPNM.
