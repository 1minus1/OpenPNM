    "The Cubic lattice network is the most commonly used pore network topology by far. When people first learn about pore network modeling they often insist on creating networks that are topologically equivalent or representative of the real network (i.e. random networks extracted from tomography images). In reality, however, a simple cubic network provides a very passable representation of more complex topologies, and provides several additional benefits as well; namely they are much easier to visualize, and applying boundary conditions is easier since the faces of the network are flat.\n",
