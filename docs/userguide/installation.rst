Installation Instructions 
===============================================================================
Installing OpenPNM is done with:

$ pip install openpnm

This will install OpenPNM into your Python environment.  To use OpenPNM, just import it:

>>> import OpenPNM
>>> OpenPNM.__version__
'1.0.0'

It is also possible to download the source code directly from Github and working from that.  This is not recommend unless you are planning to do 'development' work on the framework.  The pip install approach places the source code in the Python directory and out of harms way.

To use OpenPNM it is necessary to have Python installed on your system.  The simplest way to get Python and all the helpful add-ons. is to download the `WinPython <http://code.google.com/p/winpython/>`_ package.  This package also comes with `Spyder <http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/>`_, which provides an integrated development environment (IDE) that is very similar to Matlab, with an editor, command console, variable explorer and so on combined into the same window.  

It is also suggested to download `Paraview <http://www.paraview.org/>`_ for visualizing the networks produced by OpenPNM.
