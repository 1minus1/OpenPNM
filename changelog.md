# Changes in V2

* All module names, including the package itself, have been changed to lower-case in accord with pep8 rules

* pore-scale models can now be assigned to any object, so a model that calculates pore diameters can be assigned to a network if desired

* pore-scale models are now stored in a top level module, making then more prominent and easier to find

* A settings attribute has been added to all objects to contain various flags and values which used to be stored as hidden attributes
